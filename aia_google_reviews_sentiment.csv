AIA Australia,Google,"After AIA responded to my earlier one star review with a computer generated response and how they were sorry to hear about my experience etc requesting I forward my details to them so they could look further into my claim, this may have been perceived as a compassionate approach by them in reality though itÕs just a way of creating false hope to the disappointed policy holder on the brink of financial collapse and appeasing the concerns of those parties interested in taking out a policy as the response sent had no relevant email address attached, similar to their response to other dissatisfied customers reviews. When I forwarded my details to them via their website no second response or contact has been made by them.

AIA Australia,Google,"Still waiting, one month after a claim was submitted, (and after the expiry of the 30 day waiting period), for payment under an income protection policy. There has been zero correspondence except a letter saying the claim was received. This despite a request (as offered) on the claim documents to make contact by email. (Hopefully to make things quicker). Every correspondence has been initiated by us as claimants. We have had to chase by phone to find out what is happening with the claim. Each time weÕre told something different; the person dealing with you claim is away, (really is that a good reason to delay the claim and disadvantage us?); you need to provide proof of income, (despite having provided every payslip received this year AND a letter from the employer dated within the past month confirming proof of salary). And the current salary is higher than that weÕre claiming!!!! Far out! This insurance company appears to want to make it so difficult to claim that you simply give up... a war of attrition. And during the past two months of not being able to work due to physical disablement we still have to pay full premiums! The only thing saving us from severe financial crisis and going to the media is a credit card and a spouse with an income... I fear for others who are not able to rely on these financially supportive measures in times of crisis when you really should be able to rely on the insurer who has diligently collected your premiums for several years on the promise of protecting your ÔincomeÕ should you be unable to work. So so disappointed. And powerless it seems to effect any response or change.

Edit to post same day: so we have today received correspondence (by mail) from AIA... increasing the premium payable for the claimant! Previously the uninjured partner paid a higher premium and was insured for income double the level of the injured partner. Now, the injured partner pays more than the uninjured partner for less than half the income protection of the other! And yet there has been no funds received for the claim!

After many months back a forth with AIA and taking my complaint to AFCA I had a little win with AIA at fault and still tried to off me a "" goodwill"" aka hush money. I didn't do it for the money I did it for the struggle other families would go through. I was forced back to work after a knee reconstruction due the unethical lack of care and concerns",,03/14/2022,[Very Negative],1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Y

AIA Australia,Product Review,"Never again!. I've been waiting for an outcome on IP claim for nearly four months.My policy is for a one month waiting period through my Hesta super fund. The advertising says health workers are looked after - which is very false advertising!I'm extremely disheartened. The communication is sparse, and I get asked repeatedly for the same information even when provided numerous times. I've been constantly avoided and have spoken to my 'case' consultant once.My medical files have only just been requested after 3.5 months! Despite being told it was underway and on a one month waiting period.I'll have to hand this over to a lawyer soon as it's now beyond a joke.How do people honestly survive on this product with AIA? Or navigate this claim process if extremely ill or speak another language? All I want is a prompt answer and outcome. I don't see how this process is even legal for a policy paid for from my Super.

AIA Australia,Product Review,"Massive 268% increase in premiums over 4 years without justification. Over the course of less than 4 years AIA have increased my premiums on Life insurance, TPD, Income protection by 268%. When i noticed this i queried and had no response. It took writing a question on this forum to get a reply to which there was no justification, just a breakdown on how they increased over the 4 years. I am now a 48 year old healthy male and the majority of their increases per year being is due to age increase up to 15% PER year.I originally took out these policies to protect my family as i am a sole income provider. The idea was that if some unfortunate event occur then my family wouldn't go bankrupt. The reality of the increase is that 4 years ago, the entire cost of my policies per year was $6800 per year. These premiums are now almost $19,000 and the reality is i am more likely to go bankrupt from dealing with these crooks while i am working than if something unfortunate were to occur.Do yourself a favour and keep as far away for AIA as possible!!!! Increases of 38% a year in any product is theft and there is absolutely no justification for this and I will be raising a complaint with the ombudsman, but most importantly I will use every means available to warn others of this unscrupulous company!Examples of a couple of the policy increases are saved as images as evidence of Warning to Others",,03/14/2022,[Very Negative],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Y

AIA Australia,Product Review,"It could not get any worse. I have read all the reviews for AIA here, and thought ... they can't be true. Sadly they are. EVERYTHING with this insurance company is an argument. There is no common sense or logic. They used my sick leave paid in arrears off a forward payment ... and that seems to be okay to their complaints team. Payment was due today, but now they want another doctors review ... only had one a few months ago. I have PTSD - not a cold. They are slow to follow up, slow to answer emails, full of promises and deliver very little. In fact what they are supposed to deliver, they keep finding ways to wriggle out of. I supposedly had 24 months cover, but because my employer chose to pay me for a period of my absence, they write this off as an offset. So actually I have been paying for a policy I don't really get to fully access. I received a settlement from WC for my work place injury - and this is to 'make good' an injury that will prevent me from working in my profession again, including all my medical expenses. AIA offset the whole amount, apart from my medicare expenses and legal fees. If you have AIA Income Protection tied into your superannuation ... my advice is get out and get an independent policy with an underwriter that isn't trying to cut every corner. I knew insurance companies had a bad reputation. This lot take things to a whole new level. I have complained to them (internal complaint review - found in their favour) complained to my Super company ... they just rabbited off what AIA said, so I complained again, and I have complained to AFCRA. I now feel I have no other choice but to make others aware of this dreadful insurance premium. It comes with a health warning to the already unwell.",,03/14/2022,[Very Negative],1,0,1,1,0,0,3,Y

I expect to make a claim, once I can finally get in contact with these people. For 11 days straight the department that handles my case was unavailable due to 'technical issues'. The one time I did manage to get through, the lass could not access my policy. Just this morning I was waiting for 38 minutes without getting contact. When I hung up and rang again, the message stated that they were still having technical issues and auto-disconnected me.As such, I still haven't been able to get the details of my policy, let alone been able to make a claim.

AIA Australia,Product Review,Poor service. I made a claim through my super . The process has taken months and I have had no income for over 6 weeks. My first payment after waiting so long was hardly anything . They told me I had a 60 day waiting period but counted an entire payslip of LSL I was forced to use which covered only a few days after the 60 day period. How is this fair ? Surely they can calculate a daily figure instead of the whole fortnight.

AIA Australia,Product Review,"Poor claim process. Last year I made an income protection claim via my super. I was advised to have medical tests/MRI during Covid and see my doctor in the Melbourne CDB. During the process I received the indication is my medical tests supported my claim I would receive payment, I hurt my back quite badly and I've had Income Protection insurance for the last 15 years and this is the first claim I have made. After 4 months I received advice my claim would be denied because at the time of injury I didn't pass the work test. When Covid started I was contract worker and had to take 3 months off to home school my then 9 year old and that is when I incurred the injury. There was no allowance made for Covid for Income Protection claims (other companies did) and I was made made to travel/pay for medical tests for a claim I wasn't eligible for.
